# Unified Theory Application

A sophisticated web application that explores the integration of fundamental physical theories through computational modeling and visualization. This project combines modern web technologies with physics simulations to create an interactive platform for studying unified theories.

## Project Overview

The Unified Theory Application is designed to:
- Model and simulate interactions between different physical forces
- Visualize complex physical phenomena in real-time
- Explore relationships between various theoretical frameworks
- Provide an interactive interface for physics experimentation

### Key Components

- **Physics Subsystems**:
  - Quantum Field Theory (Basic visualization complete, advanced calculations upcoming)
  - General Relativity (Metric visualization complete, geodesic calculations upcoming)
  - Electromagnetic Forces (Basic field visualization complete, Maxwell solver upcoming)
  - Statistical Mechanics (Ideal gas calculations complete, quantum statistics upcoming)
  - Cosmological Models (Basic FLRW model complete, perturbation theory upcoming)

- **Technical Stack**:
  - Flask Backend (Python 3.8)
  - React Frontend (Node 14)
  - Docker Containerization
  - Event-Driven Architecture (Upcoming)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
